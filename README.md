# LOS â€” Logistical Operating System (Showcase)

A modular field-ops tracker evolving from a spreadsheet prototype into a polished web app.
This repo is a **public showcase**: sanitized docs, visuals, and high-level progress.  
The private codebase remains closed while we shape the MVP.

---

## ðŸ§­ What is LOS?
LOS helps teams track daily field activity (clients, visits, notes) with a **spreadsheet-like grid**, **LOA counters**, and a **territory workflow**. The MVP focuses on a fast grid UX, clear metrics, and simple admin controlsâ€”without requiring custom scripts or developer intervention.

> This showcase shares the **look & feel** and **direction** only. Implementation details, business logic, and internal docs stay private by design.

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Theme & UX Highlights
- **Grid-first Workspace** (default): address/unit, client, phone, timestamps, notes, visit #, and LOA toggles (K, D, C, DM, P, $, NiNp, V).  
- **Tabs:** Grid â€¢ Map â€¢ LOA â€¢ History (Map loads only when opened; LOA shows summary cards & trends).  
- **Color coding:** fast visual status (e.g., Contacted, Presented, Sold) with a high-contrast dark theme.  
- **Mobile:** card-based list with an edit drawer; full-screen map with a bottom sheet.

See `/docs/public/screenshots/` for the latest desktop & mobile mockups.

## ðŸ§± Tech Overview (high level)
- **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Apollo Client  
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Strawberry GraphQL, Beanie (MongoDB)  
- **Auth:** JWT (access/refresh), RBAC  
- **Monorepo:** private main repo (code) + this public showcase (docs & images)

> We intentionally omit environment/config, schemas, and internal scripts here.
